I was hesitant about putting heat on it plus wanted to do more research before i mess up my hair and leave the salon crying. I would think if i was going to always be wearing my hair natural then i shouldn’t have to straighten it to cut it. I’ve never done this before so i could be wrong, i just wanted to make sure this was correct and not a stylist just trying to make her life easier.",
