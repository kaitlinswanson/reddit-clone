        text: "I want to get a trim/cut bc i have dead ends and my natural hair lacks shape. I walked into a salon that told me they had to straighten it in order to cut it. I was hesitant about putting heat on it plus wanted to do more research before i mess up my hair and leave the salon crying. I would think if i was going to always be wearing my hair natural then i shouldn’t have to straighten it to cut it. I’ve never done this before so i could be wrong, i just wanted to make sure this was correct and not a stylist just trying to make her life easier.",
